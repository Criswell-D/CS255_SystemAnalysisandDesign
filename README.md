Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass is a website designed to provide training and education for driving. The goal of DriverPass is to train drivers to DMV standards so they can pass their driver’s exams. The client wanted a system that would be accessible online. The system needed to have students create profiles, select different types of packages, and access learning materials. The owner wanted to be able to view students’ progression and provide a secure product. The system also needed to allow the DMV to update its standards as it made changes to regulations.

What did you do particularly well?

  I feel I was able to take the clients requests and create the documents needed for the team to complete the project. Interpreting a client’s needs and requests can be difficult, but it plays an important role in completing a project. I was able to achieve this by paying close attention to the details the client provided.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my UML use case diagram. I think the diagram could have been organized in a better way. I feel in its current state that it could be difficult for a new team member to understand the information the diagram provides. I think that color coding the actors with their connections would provide more clarity and help to avoid mistakes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	
 I used what the client wanted the system to do in order to understand what a user would need to complete it. The system needed to be secure so individual profiles and specific password resetting methods were implemented. The system needed to stay up to date so the DMV was given access for when they made changes to the regulations to keep the system in line with their standards. The system is web based to give access to the most users possible. A device with an internet connection is the only requirement for a user to access the course material.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
	
 I start by reviewing any documentation available to me. I like to have as much information about the system as possible before I start designing. In the future I would use most of the techniques that I learned from this course. A Gnatt chart was new to me, and I feel like it was useful for planning out the project and think in the future it will be a helpful tool to use. In the future I would also use a similar interviewing process for the client, I think the transcript was a good source of information for the project. The business requirements and system design documents provided the proper structure to the team to design the project the client requested, I will be implementing these in future system designs.
